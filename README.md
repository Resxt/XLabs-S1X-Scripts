## What is this?

This is a collection of [XLabs](https://xlabs.dev/) S1X/AW scripts I created, written in [GSC](https://plutonium.pw/docs/modding/gsc/).  

Huge thanks to everyone who helped me learn GSC: Birchy, DoktorSAS, FutureRave and other people on Discord.  
Special thanks to DoktorSAS for helping me a lot on S1X.

## How do I download a script?

- [Download this repository](https://github.com/Resxt/XLabs-S1X-Scripts/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)
- Open the downloaded ZIP file
- Drag and drop the script(s) you want in the folder they need to be placed in.  
If no instructions are provided for the script you want then simply follow the instructions given in [How do I use a script?](#how-do-i-use-a-script)

Just keep in mind that this downloads a copy of this repository at the moment you download it.  
If a script is updated after you downloaded this repository and you want the new version then you will need to download this repository again.

## How do I use a script?

Go inside your game folder then go in `s1x\scripts` and drop a `.gsc` file there.  

Note that you can use `map_restart` in the [console](https://xlabs.dev/s1x_faq) to quickly restart your current game and reload scripts.

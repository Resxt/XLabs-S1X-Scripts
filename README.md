## What is this?

This is a collection of [XLabs](https://xlabs.dev/) S1X/AW scripts I created, written in [GSC](https://plutonium.pw/docs/modding/gsc/).  

Huge thanks to everyone who helped me learn GSC: Birchy, DoktorSAS, FutureRave and other people on Discord.  
Special thanks to DoktorSAS for helping me a lot on S1X.

## How do I download a script?

Click on a `.gsc` file and click on `Raw`.

Right click anywhere and click on `Save page as` (or an equivalent).  

Make sure to put `All` or `Any` for the file type and to add `.gsc` at the end of the file name.

## How do I use a script?

Go inside your game folder then go in `s1x\scripts` and drop a `.gsc` file there.  

Note that you can use `map_restart` in the [console](https://xlabs.dev/s1x_faq) to quickly restart your current game and reload scripts.
